## Initial Setup

1. Navigate to your project directory:

    ```
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment:

    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    Here, `venv` is the name of the virtual environment. You can change it to another name if needed.

3. Activate the created virtual environment:

    ```
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate   # For Windows
    ```

    Also, `source ./init.sh` is available for activating virtual environament on Linux/Mac

4. Install the necessary packages in the virtual environment:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Now, all the necessary packages have been installed, and the project setup is complete. You are ready to start developing.
